# Simple Weather
Simple Weather (SW) is an add-on for GMod that was formerly a paid mod and later released for free when it was discontinued by the original author, disseminate. This upload includes the base add-on & Disaster DLC packs, with a huge laundry list of changes & improvements made by yours truly.

## My goals for Simple Weather try their best to meet these specific criteria:

* **Full User Control** - As little hard-coded bits as possible, and allow the user as much control over the mod as reasonable.
* **Run Light** - Have the mod has as little performance impact as possible, and keep disk storage usage reasonably low.
* **Feature Rich** - Have the mod use a  "more with less" mentality, where it prioritizes quality over quantity.

### Features

* Day-Night Cycle, with optional real-time clock.
* Random chance dynamic weather, with options to control frequency/duration/toggle.
* Functionality for map input control (toggle street lights, etc.).
* HUD that can show current time (in either 12H or 24H mode) and weather, with options to disable.
* Map blacklist (with some pre-included entries).
* Options panels for quick changing of values and behavior in-game without map restarts.
* Weather can control [env_wind](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Env_wind) based on weather type.
* Snowy weather can change map textures to look snowy.
* Hazardous weathers can be controlled to change amount/frequency of damage, or disabled outright.
* Presets for default, potato computers, and **hardcore** modes, with the ability to customize your own.
* Emergency Alert System sounds that will play out of standard radio props when inclement weather starts - no special entities needed in your maps or your contraptions!
* A myriad of other features you'll have to try for yourself, as I suck at descriptions.
