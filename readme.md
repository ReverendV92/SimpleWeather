Simple Weather is an add-on for GMod that was formerly a paid mod and later released for free when it was discontinued by the original author, disseminate. This upload includes the base add-on & Disaster DLC packs, with a huge laundry list of changes & improvements made by yours truly.

My goals for Simple Weather try their best to meet these specific criteria:
[list]
[*][b]Full User Control[/b] - As little hard-coded bits as possible, and allow the user as much control over the mod as reasonable.
[*][b]Run Light[/b] - Have the mod has as little performance impact as possible, and keep disk storage usage reasonably low.
[*][b]Feature Rich[/b] - Have the mod use a  "more with less" mentality, where it prioritizes quality over quantity.
[/list]
